I"T<p>When designing and implemention autonomous agents, it is important to keep in mind that <em>recognition</em> is not the same as <em>understanding</em>.</p>

<h3 id="recognition">Recognition</h3>
<p>The definition of <em>recognition</em> is “identification of someone or something from previous encounters or knowledge.” The etomology of the word is from the Latin “to know again”. Recognizing things like commands in programs or hyperlinks in web documents is essential for an agent to accomplish an action.</p>

<p>Importantly, agents can recognize elements in their surroundings (real or virtual) only when they are seeing it <em>again</em>. Agents of all types, including humans, must know something about a thing ahead of time in order to recognize it later. This has important implications for how you can program (or train) an agent.</p>

<p>Conversly, <em>not</em> knowing a thing ahead of time means it is likely agents will not see it in the future. We’ve probably all had this experience ourselves. Without knowing what to look for, it is difficult to recognize objects around us.</p>
