I"<p>This is the home of the AMEE Project (Autonomous Maze Environment Explorer). AMEE was featured in a presentation at the Schloss Dagstuhl <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=21072">Seminar #21072</a> - (http://amundsen.com/talks/2021-02-dagstuhl/)[“Autonomous Agents on the Web”] in February of 2021.</p>

<p>AMEE is a “maze” agent – a simple autonomous agent that can navigate two-dimensional simple mazes of arbirary size. The (http://amundsen.com/examples/misc/maze-client.html)[original maze agent] was created in 2012 as a personal project to explore hypermedia-driven autonomous bots. It was based on a custom hypermedia format: (http://amundsen.com/media-types/maze/)[Maze+XML]. Check out the repo for additional resources including XML and RDF maze servers and a handful of Maze-compliant agents.</p>
