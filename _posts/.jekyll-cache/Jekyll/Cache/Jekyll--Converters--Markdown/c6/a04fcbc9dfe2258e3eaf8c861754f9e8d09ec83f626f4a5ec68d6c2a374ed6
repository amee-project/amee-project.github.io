I"r<p>When designing and implemention autonomous agents, it is important to keep in mind that <em>recognition</em> is not the same as <em>understanding</em>.</p>

<h3 id="recognition">Recognition</h3>
<p>The definition of <em>recognition</em> is “identification of someone or something from previous encounters or knowledge.” The etomology of the word is from the Latin “to know again”. Recognizing things like commands in programs or hyperlinks in web documents is essential for an agent to accomplish an action.</p>

<p>Importantly, agents can recognize elements in their surroundings (real or virtual) only when they are seeing it <em>again</em>. Agents of all types, including humans, must know something about a thing ahead of time in order to recognize it later. This has important implications for how you can program (or train) an agent.</p>

<p>Conversly, <em>not</em> knowing a thing ahead of time means it is likely agents will not see it in the future. We’ve probably all had this experience ourselves. Without knowing what to look for, it is difficult to recognize objects around us.</p>

<p>Recognition is required before understanding.</p>

<h3 id="understanding">Understanding</h3>
<p>The defintion for the word <em>understand</em> is “perceive the intended meaning of (words, a language, or a speaker).” Understanding something implies a grasp of the <em>meaning</em> behind it. For humans, understanding the meaning of a word or phrase is essential for communicating. If you don’t understand the words I am using, you are unlikely to grasp the meaning of what I am saying (or writing).</p>

<p>Meaning is tied to intellect and reasoning. Our understanding depends on our intelligence and our ability to reason about what we see and hear around us.</p>

<p>We often about about “intelligent agents” or training agents to “understand” new commands. But, in reality most machines do not grasp the meaning of things. They cannot reason about their surroundings. This level of agency is usually called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">“artificial general intelligence”</a> or AGI.</p>
