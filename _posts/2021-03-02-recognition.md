title: Recognition vs. Understanding
---

When designing and implemention autonomous agents, it is important to keep in mind that _recognition_ is not the same as _understanding_. 

### Recognition
The definition of _recognition_ is "identification of someone or something from previous encounters or knowledge." The etomology of the word is from the Latin "to know again". Recognizing things like commands in programs or hyperlinks in web documents is essential for an agent to accomplish an action. 

Importantly, agents can recognize elements in their surroundings (real or virtual) only when they are seeing it _again_. Agents of all types, including humans, must know something about a thing ahead of time in order to recognize it later. This has important implications for how you can program (or train) an agent. 

Conversly, _not_ knowing a thing ahead of time means it is likely agents will not see it in the future. We've probably all had this experience ourselves. Without knowing what to look for, it is difficult to recognize objects around us.
