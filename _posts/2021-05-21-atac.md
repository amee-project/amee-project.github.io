title: All the Agents Challenge (ATAC) 2021
---

_The AMEE Project is part of an international challenge to create autonomous agents on the web_

## ATAC
The [All the Agents Challenge](https://all-agents-challenge.github.io/atac2021/) (ATAC) is an event in conjunction with the [International Semantic Web Conference](https://iswc2021.semanticweb.org/) (ISWC) 2021 (October 24-28, 2021). This is an open challenge "to build agents that do things on Linked Data." It is an opportunity to build something that actually works in a cool and supportive community. I highly encourage everyone working the autonomy space to check it out.

The key dates are:

 * Release of environments: May 22, 2021
 * Submission deadline: July 22, 2021
 * Notifications: August 27, 2021
 * Challenge presentations: October 24-28, 2021
 
The criteria and other details are listed on the [ATAC 2021 home page](https://all-agents-challenge.github.io/atac2021/).

## AMEE Project and ATAC
I'm also honored that the ATAC committe selected the AMEE Project as one of the challenge environments! AMEE was first published in conjunction with the Feburary 2021 Dagstuhl seminar ["Autonomous Agents on the Web"](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=21072) and some of the same people who hosted that event are involved in the ATAC, too. 

As one of the featured environments, the ATAC team has a stable fork of the RDF implementation of the AMEE [Maze Server](https://github.com/all-agents-challenge/maze-server). 

## Contributing to the AMEE Project
If you create an agent or if you fork the server and create something new, I'd love to hear about it. Feel free to submit any PRs to the [existing repos](https://github.com/amee-project) and/or ping me if you have a standalone project repo that I can list here at the AMEE Project. 

Good luck!
