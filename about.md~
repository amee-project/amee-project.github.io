### More Information

This is the home of the AMEE Project (Autonomous Maze Environment Explorer). AMEE was featured in a presentation at the Schloss Dagstuhl [Seminar #21072](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=21072) - ["Autonomous Agents on the Web"](http://amundsen.com/talks/2021-02-dagstuhl/) in February of 2021. 

AMEE is a "maze" agent -- a simple autonomous agent that can navigate two-dimensional simple mazes of arbirary size. The [original maze agent](http://amundsen.com/examples/misc/maze-client.html) was created in 2010 as a personal project to explore hypermedia-driven autonomous bots. It is based on a custom hypermedia format: [Maze+XML](http://amundsen.com/media-types/maze/). Check out the repo for additional resources including XML and RDF maze servers and a handful of Maze-compliant agents.
